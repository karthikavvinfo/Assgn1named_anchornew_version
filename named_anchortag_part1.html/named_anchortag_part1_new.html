        <h3 id="Nehru">Pt.Jawaharlal Nehru</h3>
        <p>From the time India achieved its independence in 1947 until his death in 1964,
        the first prime minister Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru successfully led the turbulent development of the young nation.
        As a very liberal, social democrat, and secular statesman who learned from Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru is remembered
        for having firmly set India on the path it is currently traveling. In addition to being a man of letters,
        Nehru is recognized for founding the Indian Planning Commission.<br> On his return to India, Nehru at first had tried 
        to settle down as a lawyer. Unlike his father, however, he had only a desultory interest in his profession and did
        not relish either the practice of law or the company of lawyers. For that time he might be described, like many of
        his generation, as an instinctive nationalist who yearned for his country’s freedom, but, like most of his contemporaries,
        he had not formulated any precise ideas on how it could be achieved.<br>Nehru’s autobiography discloses his lively
        interest in Indian politics during the time he was studying abroad. His letters to his father over the same period 
        reveal their common interest in India’s freedom. But not until father and son met Mahatma Gandhi and were persuaded 
        to follow in his political footsteps did either of them develop any definite ideas on how freedom was to be attained.</p>

        <h3 id="Ambedkar">B.R.Ambedkar</h3>
        <p> B. R Ambedkar was the most influential person in India who held various and performed various roles throughout 
        his entire life in the form of a governmental figurehead, writer, lawyer, philosopher, linguist, historian, 
        revolutionary, and many more. Despite the fact that his opinions were disliked, he continued to speak up as a 
        revolutionary leader.  He also brought back Buddhism to the nation, leaving an impact that is still visible in
        Dalit communities, a goal that Ambedkar fought for all of his life. Ambedkar is regarded as the creator of the
        Indian Constitution, in whose honor the country commemorated Republic Day<br>Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891
        in the town and military cantonment of Mhow (now officially known as Dr Ambedkar Nagar) (now in Madhya Pradesh).
        He was the 14th and last child of Ramji Maloji Sakpal, an army officer who held the rank of Subedar, and Bhimabai
        Sakpal, daughter of Laxman Murbadkar. His family was of Marathi background from the town of Ambadawe 
        (Mandangad taluka) in Ratnagiri district of modern-day Maharashtra. Ambedkar was born into a Mahar (dalit) caste
        who were treated as untouchables and subjected to socio-economic discrimination.<br>Ambedkar's ancestors had long
        worked for the army of the British East India Company, and his father served in the British Indian Army at the
        Mhow cantonment.Although they attended school, Ambedkar and other untouchable children were segregated and given
        little attention or help by teachers. They were not allowed to sit inside the class. When they needed to drink
        water, someone from a higher caste had to pour that water from a height as they were not allowed to touch either 
        the water or the vessel that contained it. This task was usually performed for the young Ambedkar by the school
        peon, and if the peon was not available then he had to go without water; he described the situation later in his
        writings as "No peon, No Water". He was required to sit on a gunny sack which he had to take home with him.</p>

        <h3 id="Vajpayee">Atal Bihari Vajpayee</h3>    
        <p>Atal Bihari Vajpayee who came from the Bharatiya Janata Party was one of the great leaders of India. 
        He held the position of Prime Minister of India from 1999 to 2004, the only Prime Minister to hold the office 
        of PM for the entirety of a 5 years term outside of Congress Party at that time. He was a poet also and famed 
        for his outstanding speeches. He was honored with Padam Vibhushan, the second highest citizenship award in India. 
        He entered into politics by joining the Bhartiya Jana Sangh in 1951 and quit all political activity in 2005. He 
        took his last breath on 16th August 2018 at AIIMS in New Delhi. Under the leadership of Vajpayee, India successfully
        conducted a nuclear test.Vajpayee was born into a Hindu Brahmin family on 25 December 1924 in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh.<br>
        His mother was Krishna Devi and his father was Krishna Bihari Vajpayee. His father was a school teacher in their 
        home town.His grandfather, Shyam Lal Vajpayee, had migrated to Morena near Gwalior from his ancestral village of
        Bateshwar in the Agra district of Uttar Pradesh.Vajpayee did his schooling at the Saraswati Shishu Mandir in 
        Gwalior. In 1934, he was admitted to the Anglo-Vernacular Middle (AVM) School in Barnagar, Ujjain district, 
        after his father joined as headmaster. He subsequently attended Gwalior's Victoria College, Agra University 
        (now Maharani Laxmi Bai Govt. College of Excellence) where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Hindi, English 
        and Sanskrit. He completed his post-graduation with a Master of Arts in political science from DAV College, Kanpur,
        Agra University.<br>By 1942, at the age of 16 years, Vajpayee became an active member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak 
        Sangh (RSS). Although the RSS had chosen not to participate in the Quit India Movement, in August 1942, Vajpayee and 
        his elder brother Prem were arrested for 24 days during the Quit India Movement. He was released after giving a written 
        statement that while he was a part of the crowd, he did not participate in the militant events in Bateshwar on 27 August 
        1942. Throughout his life, including after he became prime minister, Vajpayee has labelled the allegation of participation 
        in the Quit India Movement to be a false rumour.</p>

        <h3 id="Shastri">Lal Bahadur Shastri</h3>
        <p>One of the most prominent and fearless leaders whom India can never have back in is Lal Bahadur Shastri. 
        Although it was never going to be simple, Lal Bahadur Shastri succeeded admirably in matching the footsteps of 
        Jawaharlal Nehru. In keeping with Nehru’s socialist values, he provided the motto “Jai Jawan Jai Kisaan ” and 
        functioned zealously for the agricultural sector in India. Under the leadership of Lal Bahadur Shastri, India 
        defeated Pakistan in the war of 1965 which made him a legend to be remembered eternally. After achieving the 
        victory over Pakistan, Shastri went to Tashkent, Uzbek SSR, the Soviet Union for a meeting where he died because
        of a heart attack.Shastri was born to Sharada Prasad Srivastava and Ramdulari Devi in Mughalsarai on 2 October 1904.<br>
        He studied in East Central Railway Inter college and Harish Chandra High School, which he left to join the non-cooperation movement. 
        He worked for the betterment of the Harijans at Muzaffarpur and dropped his caste-derived surname of "Srivastava". Shastri's t
        thoughts were influenced by reading about Swami Vivekananda, Mahatma Gandhi and Annie Besant. Deeply impressed and 
        influenced by Gandhi, he joined the Indian Independence movement in the 1920s. He served as the president of Servants 
        of the People Society (Lok Sevak Mandal), founded by Lala Lajpat Rai and held prominent positions in Indian National 
        Congress. Following independence in 1947, he joined the Indian government and became one of Prime Minister Nehru's key
        cabinet colleagues, first as Railways Minister (1951–56), and then in numerous other prominent positions, including the 
        Home Minister.<br>
        As prime minister, Shastri promoted the White Revolution – a national campaign to increase the production and supply 
        of milk – by supporting the Amul milk co-operative of Anand, Gujarat and creating the National Dairy Development Board. 
        Underlining the need to boost India's food production, Shastri also promoted the Green Revolution in India in 1965. 
        This led to an increase in food grain production, especially in the states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. 
        He led the country during the Second India–Pakistan War. His slogan "Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan" ("Hail to the soldier; Hail
        to the farmer") became very popular during the war. The war formally ended with the Tashkent Declaration on 10 January
        1966; Shastri died the next day.</p>

        <h3 id="VallabhbhaiPatel">Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel</h3>  
        <p>Born on 31 October 1875 in Nadiad, Bombay Presidency (present-day Gujarat), Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was a great 
        leader who handled the situation remarkably at the time of partition after independence. At the time of independence, 
        India was not received as an entire territory. It was split up into nations at the time, whose rulers pushed for unrestrained 
        rights or attempted to maintain their neutral status. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel gained the moniker “India’s Iron Man” 
        by dealing with each of them forcefully and harshly. Patel was born in Nadiad, Kheda district and raised in the countryside 
        of the state of Gujarat.He was a successful lawyer.<br> One of Mahatma Gandhi's earliest political lieutenants, he organised 
        peasants from Kheda, Borsad and Bardoli in Gujarat in non-violent civil disobedience against the British Raj, becoming 
        one of the most influential leaders in Gujarat. He was appointed as the 49th President of Indian National Congress, 
        organising the party for elections in 1934 and 1937 while promoting the Quit India Movement.As the first Home Minister 
        and Deputy Prime Minister of India, Patel organised relief efforts for partition refugees fleeing to Punjab and Delhi 
        from Pakistan and worked to restore peace. Besides those provinces that had been under direct British rule, approximately 
        565 self-governing princely states had been released from British suzerainty by the Indian Independence Act of 1947. 
        <br>Patel, together with Nehru and Menon persuaded almost every princely state to accede to India.Patel's commitment 
        to national integration in the newly independent country earned him the sobriquet "Iron Man of India".He is also 
        remembered as the "patron saint of India's civil servants" for playing a pioneering role in establishing the modern 
        All India Services system. The Statue of Unity, the world's tallest statue which was erected by the Indian government 
        at a cost of US$420 million, was dedicated to him on 31 October 2018 and is approximately 182 metres (597 ft) in height.</p>

        <h3 id="AbdulKalam">APJ Abdul Kalam</h3> 
        <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR (15 October 1931-27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman 
        who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and 
        studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, 
        mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and 
        was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.He thus came 
        to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle 
        technology.<br> He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear 
        tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.Kalam was elected as the 11th president 
        of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National 
        Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",he returned to his civilian life of education, writing 
        and public service after a single term.<br>He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, 
        India's highest civilian honour.While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, 
        Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands, including national-
        level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full 
        state honours.</p>

        <h3 id="Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</h3>
        <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[pron 1] (2 October 1869-30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial 
        nationalist and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for 
        India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. 
        The honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"), first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa, 
        is now used throughout the world.Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in 
        the law at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891.<br>After two uncertain 
        years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to 
        represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. It was here that 
        Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 
        45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against 
        excessive land-tax and discrimination.Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi 
        led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, 
        ending untouchability, and, above all, achieving swaraj or self-rule. <br>Gandhi adopted the short dhoti woven 
        with hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor. He began to live in a self-sufficient 
        residential community, to eat simple food, and undertake long fasts as a means of both introspection and 
        political protest. Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging 
        the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930 and in calling for the British 
        to quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned many times and for many years in both South Africa and India.</p>

        <h3 id="RGandhi">Rajiv Gandhi</h3> 
        <p>Rajivaratna Gandhi (20 August 1944-21 May 1991) was an Indian politician who served as the sixth prime minister 
        of India from 1984 to 1989. He took office after the assassination of his mother, then–prime minister Indira Gandhi, 
        to become the youngest Indian prime minister at the age of 40. During his tenure, Gandhi introduced several 
        initiatives and policies aimed at modernising India and promoting economic development. He emphasised technology, 
        computerisation, and telecommunications, launching the "Vision 2020" program to transform India into a technologically 
        advanced nation.Gandhi was not related to the world-famous Mahatma Gandhi. <br>Instead, he was from the politically 
        powerful Nehru–Gandhi family, which had been associated with the Indian National Congress party. For much of his 
        childhood, his maternal grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru was prime minister. Gandhi attended the University of 
        Cambridge in the United Kingdom. He returned to India in 1966 and became a professional pilot for the state-owned 
        Indian Airlines. In 1968, he married Sonia Maino; the couple settled in Delhi for a domestic life with their 
        children Rahul and Priyanka.<br>For much of the 1970s, his mother was prime minister and his brother Sanjay an MP; 
        despite this, Gandhi remained apolitical. After Sanjay died in a plane crash in 1980, Gandhi reluctantly entered 
        politics at the behest of his mother. The following year he won his brother's Parliamentary seat of Amethi and 
        became a member of the Lok Sabha—the lower house of India's Parliament. As part of his political grooming, 
        Rajiv was made general secretary of the Congress party and given significant responsibility in organising the 
        1982 Asian Games.</p>
